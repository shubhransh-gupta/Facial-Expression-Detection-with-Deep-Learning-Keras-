# Facial-Expression-Detection-with-Deep-Learning-Keras-

Facial Expression or Facial Emotion Detector can be used to know whether a person is sad, happy, angry and so on only through his/her face. This Repository can be used to carry out such a task. It uses your WebCamera and then identifies your expression in
Real Time. Yeah in real-time! It also works on any image.

I have build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Keras from scratch to recognize facial expressions. The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The objective is to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories 
# (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).
